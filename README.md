# DilmesIpsum for [Sublime Text Editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

Check out our <a href="http://thiagoh.github.io/sublime-dilmes-ipsum" target="_blank">GitHub Page</a>!

An extension for Sublime Text 2 and 3! It allows you to insert Dilmes Ipsum in the editor via menu items or keyboard shortcuts. It uses some popular phrases from [Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilma_Rousseff)

Select how much text you want from the menu item in `Edit->Text->Dilmes Ipsum` or on the right click menu in `Dilmes Ipsum`.

Just press the shortcut key `Alt+Shift+D` to add Dilmes Ipsum text. Keep pressing to add more.

Alternatively, you can also type `dilma` or `dilmes` followed by a `TAB` so that paragraphs will be added.

## Features

1. Randomly generates text from selection of phrases
2. Leaves the inserted text un-selected, so you can insert some more straight away (rapid tapping to get as much lorem as you want)
3. Shortcut key, `Edit -> Text -> Dilmes Ipsum...` sub-menu, and context menu activation
4. Works with multiple selection ranges
5. Does not leave trailing spaces

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Dilmes%20Ipsum).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on OS X, Control+Shift+P on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Type `DilmesIpsum` when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.

Report bugs here, and I will do my best to repair them (or better still - make the fix, and send me a pull request).
